  <h1>About the Quiver Mutation Database (QMD)</h1>

  <p>
  The <strong>Quiver Mutation Database (QMD)</strong> is an open research
  infrastructure for quivers, exchange matrices, and mutation-equivalence
  classes arising in cluster algebras, representation theory, and related
  areas of algebra and geometry.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  Quiver mutation is a central operation in modern algebraic combinatorics, 
  but its combinatorial complexity grows rapidly. Even for modest numbers 
  of vertices, mutation-equivalence classes can be large, infinite, or 
  difficult to explore systematically. As a result, much of the existing 
  knowledge about mutation classes, invariants, and exceptional phenomena 
  is scattered across papers, personal code, and ad hoc datasets.
  </p>
    
  </p>
  QMD is designed to address this gap by providing a curated, citable, and 
  reproducible database of quivers and mutation classes, together with 
  rigorously defined invariants and transparent computational provenance. 
  The project is inspired by successful community resources such as the 
  <a href="https://www.lmfdb.org/">L-functions and Modular Forms Database (LMFDB)</a>, 
  and aims to bring similar infrastructure principles to the study of quiver mutation.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Design principles</h2>
  </p>
  QMD is built around the following core principles:
  </p>
  
  <p><strong>Stable identifiers</strong><br />
  Each quiver is assigned a permanent identifier determined by a canonical 
  representative up to relabeling. Mutation-equivalence classes are 
  likewise identified by canonical representatives, with clear documentation 
  of exploration limits when full enumeration is not possible.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Reproducibility and provenance</strong><br />
  All computed data are accompanied by metadata describing how values 
  were obtained, including algorithmic assumptions, software versions, 
  and references where applicable.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Forward-facing with room to grow</strong><br />
  New invariants, frozen vertices, and skew-symmetrizable matrices will all 
  need to be added eventually. The database will be built so that
  future expansion is a core design principle, not an afterthought.
  </p>
    
  <p><strong>Accessibility to a mathematical audience</strong><br />
  The data, which forms the backbone of this project, should be easily
  filterable, searchable, viewable, and downloadable. The goal of the database
  is to promote data-driven research in the mathematical community, and that
  starts with a low-barrier-to-entry public-facing component.
  </p>
